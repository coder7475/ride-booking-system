# üß© Test_School Competency Assessment Platform Frontend

A modern, scalable platform for assessing and certifying digital competencies (levels A1 to C2), built with a TypeScript monorepo architecture using Turborepo. The frontend leverages **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, **Redux**, and **Tailwind CSS**, while the backend uses **Express.js** and **MongoDB**. This system supports a three-step assessment process, secure authentication, question management, and certificate generation.
